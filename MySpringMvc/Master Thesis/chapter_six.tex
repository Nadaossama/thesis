In this chapter we will discuss how our system could be evaluated. In \textit{ChapterTwo} we discussed the different methods used to evaluate decision support systems. Unfortunately they couldn't be applied in our scenario as our prototype was developed as a proof of concept to prove that a decision support system could benefit the connect hydro project and that combining two types of decision support can be advantageous and optimize power plants energy production.

SInce our system didn't have any users, there was no possibility to perform evaluation. Therefore, evaluation was reduced to checking that all the functionalities are included and are performing as expected. The functionalities include:
% \begin{itemize}

% \end{itemize}

In Connect Hydro, a qualitative benefit study was conducted through meetings with experts and power plants operators. In the study a few situations were studied and discussed that if a decision support system could prevent these events from happening then it will be a great interest to them and will motivate them to implement the system and help convince other operators to join the project.

The Data visualization could be an interesting tool that could help our system predict future trends in energy production based on the history as well as some external resources like weather forecasting
