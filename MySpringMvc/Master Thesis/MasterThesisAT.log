Class scrreprt Warning: \float@addtolists detected!
(scrreprt)              Implementation of \float@addtolist became
(scrreprt)              deprecated in KOMA-Script v3.01 2008/11/14 and
(scrreprt)              has been replaced by several more flexible
(scrreprt)              features of package `tocbasic`.
(scrreprt)              Since Version 3.12 support for deprecated
(scrreprt)              \float@addtolist interface has been
(scrreprt)              restricted to only some of the KOMA-Script
(scrreprt)              features and been removed from others.
(scrreprt)              Loading of package `scrhack' may help to
(scrreprt)              avoid this warning, if you are using a

Class scrreprt Warning: deprecated old font command `\sc' used.
(scrreprt)              You should note, that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a
(scrreprt)              new font selection scheme called NFSS2 with several
(scrreprt)              new, combinable font commands. New KOMA-Script classes
(scrreprt)              have defined the old font commands like `\sc' only for
(scrreprt)              compatibility with LaTeX 2.09 document styles of
(scrreprt)              Script 2.0. These commands are deprecated and
(scrreprt)              undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013,
(scrreprt)              KOMA-Script classes warn about soon removement of
(scrreprt)              these deprecated commands. Now, after two decades of
(scrreprt)              LaTeX2e, NFSS2, and KOMA-Script these commands will
(scrreprt)              not work any longer. If loading a package results in
(scrreprt)              this message you should contact the author of that
(scrreprt)              package and ask him to replace the depracted font
(scrreprt)              command `\sc', e.g., by `\normalfont \scshape '.
(scrreprt)              Otherwise you should reconfigure or replace the
(scrreprt)              package. If you have used the old font command
